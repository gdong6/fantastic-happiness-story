There is polar bear walking on the ice, and he notice there is a human in front of him. He says "bro, why don't you wear a white coat";

The human responds, "Bro, why aren't you wearing skin?"
The bear fumed at that response. Just because he had the semblance of no skin, doesn't mean he doesn't 
have any skin! As the pair continued along their journey to the edge of the world, the bear plotted
various petty ways of revenge against his comrade.

However, the plans were not to come to fruition. A few days after the trivial incident, they 
stumbled upon an abandoned city. The structures looked intact, and everything seems to be in good order.
This was the town of Dorado, the first stop at which they could safely take a break from their long
and arduous journey. And here, the glorious city sat, lifeless and eerily silent.

Then they heard something. It sounded like someone was screaming and was in need for help. 
They went closer to the noice and saw another polar bear. He was asking for food so the human took 
out his food that he had picked up during their journey. The hungry polar bear ate as fast as he could.
Then all three of them continued the jorney to the edge of the world.
